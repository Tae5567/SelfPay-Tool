## Original User Request:
Help me build this(has to be built within 24-48hours): The main idea behind the project is we run a medical practice and we have a self-pay price list, which is basically how much we charge for each service out-of-pocket. Basically, we want to make a simple web tool where a front desk person or any staff member really can search for a service. The web tool will highlight the services, how much they cost, and they can build a cart or at least select multiple of them and determine the final pricing or basically the dollar value they need to collect from the patient. I think key features here will be search, also dropdown, or most commonly chosen services, things like that. We can start with basic services, but over time I want to build in all of the pricing. For things like urgent care, primary care, CDL, immigration physicals, nutrition visits, psychiatry visits, spravato, all of those things eventually want to be built in. But just to start a simple MVP that we can start testing and going live with the front desk staff would be really helpful. The key people to work with on this will be Cyrel, C-Y-R-E-L, from the operations team to help get this deployed. Let's start with her. Build the tool, get it deployed, get it used, and there should be some good savings opportunity here.
